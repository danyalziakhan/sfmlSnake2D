# sfmlSnake2D â€“ Classic Snake Game in C++ with SFML

## Details

A simple yet fully functional 2D Snake game developed using the SFML graphics library in C++. Originally designed for Linux platforms, it was later ported to Windows. The project focuses on clean rendering with 2D sprites, responsive controls, and a modular code structure. It includes music and sound effects, and also integrates TGUI for user interface components. This makes it ideal for demonstrating foundational game development and real-time rendering logic in C++.

## Building

It requires SFML 2.1+ and TGUI.
